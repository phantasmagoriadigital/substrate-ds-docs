# Theming

Substrate DS supports a dark theme along with the original, default light theme.

## Enabling the Dark Theme

To enable the dark theme, simply add the `dark-theme` CSS class to your body element. This will apply the dark theme globally.

## Mixed Use

Individual sections or components can override their inherited theme on a case-by-case basis, enabling the render of an element with a light theme in an predominantly dark-themed interface and vice versa.

You can also apply the `light-theme` class on individual components. For example:

```html
<sux-button class="light-theme">Submit</rux-button>
```
